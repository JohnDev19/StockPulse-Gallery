# Stock Pulse Gallery

This web application is part of a web development project to download a collection of stock photos and royalty-free images. The goal is to eventually implement a feature that allows users to upload and manage their own images from personal sources without relying on any external APIs.

## Features

- Search for images
- Filter images by orientation (All, Landscape, Portrait, Square)
- Sort images by relevance, latest, or popularity
- View image details in a modal
- Download images directly to your device

## Set up your Unsplash access key (if using the API):

Open the script.js file and find the following line:
```javascript
const accessKey = 'your_unsplash_access_key_here';
```

Replace 'your_unsplash_access_key_here' with your actual Unsplash access key if you want to use the API for fetching images.

## Acknowledgments
- This project uses the Unsplash API to fetch high-quality images (optional).
- Inspired by platforms like Unsplash, Pexels, and Pixabay, which provide a wealth of free stock photos and resources.

## Future Implementation
In future updates, this project will focus on allowing users to upload and manage their own images directly within the application eliminating the need for external APIs.
